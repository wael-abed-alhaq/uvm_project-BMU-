1.	Count leading zero bits
o	When the input is zero (a_in=0) the result in the design give me 32 but the correct answer is 0 because no ones in the number 

2.	Count trailing zero bits
o	When the input is zero (a_in=0) the result in the design gives me 32 but the correct answer is 0 because no ones in the number 

3.	Packu
There is a bug in  the design
